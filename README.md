# Blog-List-Frontend
Part 5 of the FSO course @ Open University, Helsinki, https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5

# The main focus of this part was authorization and authentication with React and Axios and then, learning to test React components Jest and react-testing-library
Once the frontend tests were done, we moved into E2E testing, where I learned to e2e test with the new library Cypress, which is btw, Super easy to setup and use.

# Things I learned in this part:
- Authentication requests via axios and React, with the help of useEffect hooks and the localStorage.
- Authorization handling with tokens sent by the server.
- Basics of react-testing-library and it's usage with Jest, setting up my own component tests.
- Props.children and also Prop.Types library.
- Linting with Airbnb's config in React.
- Higher order Components.
- E2E testing with Cypress, setting up my own tests, writing up custom commands.
- A LOT OF BUGFIXING, how to spot bugs, how react behaves when there are obvious bugs.
